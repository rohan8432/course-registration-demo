Ans: 
First of all , I have to manage that how I can hold my fake data. That's why I am using State of initial course data for my API. 

Second, I have to use State for selected course. Where I want to click on the select button it will return each data of course.

Fourth, Then I have to use State for set the price of each course. Where it show the total price of each product. 

Finally, Use the State for Showing the remaining value of credits.
